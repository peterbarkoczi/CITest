* Selenium WebDriver test automation project for testing various Atlassian Jira features:
(login, logout, browse projects / issues, create / edit issues, validate Glass Documentation's content)

* Automated tests are based on previously written manual test cases (a few included in a separate folder)

* Project's main goal was to use advanced testing techniques like Page Object Model with Page Factory pattern and to separate Selenium methods and logic from the test cases

* There are several Data Driven Testing techniques in the test cases as data sources

* The strict adherence of the Java OOP principles was an important aspect during the whole project.
